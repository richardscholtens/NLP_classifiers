# NLP_classifiers
Contains algorithms to train machine learning models using a variety of classifier strategies.


These steps can be followed as a reference:

1. The data to train your model can be found in data\sentiment_competition_train.csv
2. Pre-process dataset
3. Split dataset into a training and validation set
4. Vectorize data
5. Train model using classification algorithm
6. Validate trained model using validation dataset
7. Improve model/pre-processing/vectorizer etc.
8. Evaluate with the test set and hope for the best!
